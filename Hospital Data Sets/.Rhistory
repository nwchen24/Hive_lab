#These results imply that from a baseline birthweight of 119.79 ounces, all else equal, if a mother smokes one additional cigarette per day during pregnancy, our model predicts that her baby will weigh .51 oz less at birth.
#The R-squared of this model is 0.02 indicating that 2% of the variation of bwght is explained by the variable cigs. This means that there is a lot of variation in bwght that is not explained in our model.
#Using bwght in its raw form is probably OK, because we have seen it is fairly normally distributed.
#However, using cigs in its raw form may not be adviseable because of the huge concentration (>80%) of mothers who smoked zero cigarettes per day during pregnancy.
#Since we have quite a bit of data, we could consider running the same regression specification while removing mothers who smoked zero cigarettes per day.
#This specification would be slightly different than the one we've estimated here as it would give the estimated effect on birthweight of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy conditional on mothers having smoked any cigarettes during pregnancy.

#There are extreme values like 50 cigarettes per day while pregnant.
#This seems a bit unreasonable. If we assume each mother got 8 hours of sleep per night, this means she smoked about 3 cigarettes per hour for the entirety of her pregnancy. This is a lot of cigagrettes, but certainly within  the realm of possibility.
#The number of cigarettes smoked per day while pregnant does not appear to be top or bottom coded.
