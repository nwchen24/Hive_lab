For this question, I used the hospital level summary of the HCAHPS survey and the timely and effective care dataset. Based on my personal experience, one of the most important factors shaping my impression of a hospital is how well the staff communicates. As such, I decided to limit my analysis of patient experience to communications related questions.I ranked hospitals according to both their performance on questions “Patients who reported that their nurses "Sometimes" or "Never" communicated well” and “Patients who reported that their doctors "Sometimes" or "Never" communicated well”. A high score on these questions indicates that a large proportion of patients experienced poor doctor and nurse communication. Thus, a high rank indicates poor communication. I then added the ranks together for doctor and nurse communication. The hospitals with the highest scores performed worst on the communication metrics.Next to see whether patient experience is correlated with hospital quality, I got the correlation between this poor communication indicator and the composite hospital quality score I created earlier. We would expect to observe a negative correlation between this quality score and the poor communication indicator.In practice, we do in fact observe a negative correlation of -0.136 which is a medium effect size.
