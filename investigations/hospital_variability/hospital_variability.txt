For the hospital variability measure, I relied upon the same assumptions about the score variable as described in my best_hospitals response. I identified the measures with the greatest variability between hospitals by taking the highest and lowest scores observed for each measure in the timely and effective care dataset. I define the measures with the highest variability as those with the largest gap between these highest and lowest scores.Based on this methodology, the ten measures with the most variability between hospitals are copied below.1.	Stroke Education2.	Immunization for influenza3.	Prophylactic antibiotic received within 1 hour prior to surgical incision4.	Evaluation of LVS Function5.	Discharge instructions6.	ICU venous thromboembolism prophylaxis7.	Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis8.	ED29.	Surgery Patients Who Received Appropriate Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis Within 24 Hours Prior to Surgery to 24 Hours After SurgeryVenous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis
