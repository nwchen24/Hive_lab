To derive the best hospitals, I mainly used the score variable in the "Timely and Effective Care - Hospital.csv” dataset and the score variable in the “Readmissions and Deaths – Hospital.csv” dataset. Because of a lack of documentation about the interpretation of these variable I had to make some assumptions about their interpretation. Specifically, I assumed that score in both datasets was intended to record the proportion of patients for a particular measure who received timely and effective care or who were readmitted. As such, I removed all scores above 100 and all scores that were reported as non-numeric as scores that could not be used for this exercise.For readmissions, I only kept measures where a hospital was either better or worse than the national average as these are the instances that will help us to assess the best and worst hospitals. I counted the number of measures for which a hospital was both better and worse than the national average of readmission rate.	
I then created a composite hospital score that credits hospital for giving timely and effective care on a wide variety of measures and adjusting upward by the number of readmission rates better than the national average and downward for readmission rates worse than the national average. This measure is calculated for each hospital as the average timely and effective care score multiplied by the number of measures on which that hospital was measured plus three times the number of measures on which the hospital was above the national average readmission rate less five times the number of measures on which that hospital was below the national average readmission rate.Based on this composite measure, the top ten best hospitals are listed below with the best hospital listed at the top of the list.1.
