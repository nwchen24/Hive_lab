In my ranking of the best states I reiterate the same caveats described in my rankings of the best hospitals because I utilize the methodology to rank the best hospitals in order to identify the states with the overall best hospitals.To identify the states with the best hospitals, I found the median of my composite hospital care score across all hospitals. I then ranked states by the proportion of their hospitals that fall above the national median score. I do not include any metric that credits a state for having a large number of hospitals. This is because I assume that each state has a sufficient number of hospitals to care for its population appropriately â€“ by relying on the basics of simple supply and demand, this is a reasonable assumption.Based on this methodology, the top ten states with the best overall quality of hospital care are listed below.1.	RI2.	ME3.	WA4.	MI5.	UT6.	ID7.	WV8.	CT9.	MA10.	OR
